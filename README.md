# GZipper

<b>Motivation:</b><br>

This JAVA program is mainly for practicing. It builds on a seminary work and as my main archiving program does not support creating GZIP/TAR archives, I thought this would be a great opportunity to enhance my skills.<br>
<br>
<b>How it works:</b><br>

Select files/folders to put them into an archive (tar.gz). The archive will be created in the same folder where the JAR-file is located. If there is already an archive with the default or same name, a second file (and so on...) will be created. This ensures that no old files will be overwritten. Extraction works the same, you select an archive and it will be extracted into a subfolder in the directory of the executable app. Custom paths for zip/unzip locations are currently not supported.<br>
<br>
<b>This application requires Java 1.8 (Java 8)</b>

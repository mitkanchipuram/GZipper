# GZipper

<b>How it works:</b><br>

Select files/folders to put them into an archive (tar.gz). By default, the archive will be created in the same folder where the JAR-file is located. Custom paths for output file(s) are also supported. If there is already an archive with the default or same name, a second file (and so on...) will be created. This ensures that no old file will be overwritten. Extraction works the same, you select an archive and it will be extracted into a subfolder of the specified directory.<br>

This app also supports compressing and extracting archives using the ZIP (.zip) algorithm. This needs to be enabled via the options menu. Furthermore, this application is compatible with unix-based systems.
